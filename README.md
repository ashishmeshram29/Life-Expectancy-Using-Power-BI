# Life-Expectancy-Using-Power-BI
This a college mini project of data analysis domain . We have Analysis the WHO dataset for life expectancy.
This project will analyze life expectancy data by looking at factors such as immunizations, mortality, finances, social factors, and other health-related issues. It will make it easier for a country to identify the predicting factor contributing to a lower life expectancy value. This will also aid in recommending to a country which areas should be prioritized to effectively raise the population's life expectancy.
We are using the life expectancy dataset by WHO on Kaggle for Life Expectancy Data Analysis. Power BI visualization types such as Gauge Charts, Pie Charts, Line Charts, and Point Maps can be used for the overview page, while Tornado Charts, Doughnut Charts, Treemaps can be used for depicting country-wise data, etc.
